automated mailings (html, attachments, tls connection)

This python application was developped with a rather simple user experience in mind. To use the mail-bot you don't need any programming skills and can just follow this guide.

First of all: never post the critical information in the source code itself. For example, password strings etc. could be inputted in command line interactions!
